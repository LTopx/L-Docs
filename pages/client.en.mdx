### Basic Information

The Windows and Mac clients of Le-AI are packaged using **Tauri + NextJS** and are currently in the **Beta** version.

- We do not plan to provide a user system now or in the future. You can only configure API Key for usage.
- Due to technical reasons, there is currently no multilingual support available. Only English language is supported.
- There is no plugin system or session sharing functionality at the moment.
- As it is still in Beta version, there may be some issues. If you encounter any problems, please provide feedback on [Issues](https://github.com/LTopx/Le-AI/issues).

### How to Use

Since the client does not provide a user system, you can only configure an API Key to use.

#### Using Le-AI Key

> The Le-AI Key is an API Key generated on the Le-AI Web platform for use within the Le-AI ecosystem. Once configured, it will have the same permissions as the account that generated this API Key.

- Generation: Generate it on the token page in your account center at the top right corner of the system. https://le-ai.app/account/token

- The newly generated token is **disabled by default** and needs to be manually enabled.
- After generation, click on the copy button to copy the API Key.
