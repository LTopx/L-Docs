# Cloud synchronization

### Introduction

This is a controversial and costly matter. The following are the planned directions for development:

- Real-time account configuration and synchronization of chat session content will not be provided. Users will only be allowed to manually synchronize the session to avoid privacy concerns.
- Free synchronization functionality will be provided in the early stages when costs are low. If costs become too high in the future, fees may be considered.
