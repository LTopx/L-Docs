# Team

### Introduction

In order to better serve teams, L-GPT will provide a team version service in the future. The following features are planned in the preliminary stage:

- Any user can create a team. As the team leader, they can provide their own API Key or API quota for team members to use.
- Each team can accommodate a limited number of people.
- Members in a team do not need to provide their own API Key or API quota, they can directly use the team's API Key or API quota to access all functions of L-GPT.
