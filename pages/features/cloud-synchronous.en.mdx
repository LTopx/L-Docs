# Cloud synchronization

### Introduction

Allows users to manually backup and sync system settings and session content to the cloud for use on different devices.

### Backup Rules

- L-GPT will never automatically sync any of your information. This includes but is not limited to session lists, configuration information, and various API keys.
- All backup and restore operations in L-GPT can only be triggered manually, and there are no plans to develop automatic backup and restore functionality in the future.
- All data is stored locally on the browser and device by default, and no one else except yourself can access this data.
- When using the backup and cloud sync feature, L-GPT will encrypt the data locally with an AES encryption key provided by you before uploading it to the cloud. The same key is required for decryption during data restoration.
- Please make sure to keep your encryption key safe. If you forget the key, there is no way to recover your backed-up data.

  Special Note:

- Each backup will overwrite existing backup data in the cloud without merging or compatibility handling. Previous backup data will be lost.
- Each time you restore data, it will overwrite all local data without merging or compatibility handling.
- Currently, backups only support full backups including session lists, system configurations, and API keys.

### Operate

#### Backup

- Click on the ☁️ backup button in the lower left corner of the system, enter your local encryption key, and click the `Backup` button. The system will encrypt your data using AES encryption algorithm with the encryption key you entered, and then upload it to the cloud.

#### Restore

- Click on the ☁️ backup button in the lower left corner of the system, enter your local encryption key, and click the `Restore` button. The system will retrieve encrypted data from the cloud using your inputted encryption key and decrypt it using a local key.
