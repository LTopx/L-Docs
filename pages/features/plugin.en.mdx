# Plugin

## Google Search (New)

### Introduction

ChatGPT's training data is only up until September 2021, so it cannot answer many real-time information questions. To address this issue, we have integrated the Google Search plugin, which allows ChatGPT to provide answers to some real-time information. There are several Google search APIs available on the market, and after conducting research, we have chosen a popular one: [Serper](https://serper.dev/).

Compared to Google's official search API, this API has the following advantages:

- Simple configuration without complex application processes for obtaining engine IDs and API keys like the official API.
- Each account has a free search quota of 2500 times.
- It claims to be the world's fastest and cheapest Google search API: The World's Fastest and Cheapest
  Google Search API.

### How to Obtain

- Go to Serper's official website: https://serper.dev and register an account.
- After successful registration, switch to the `API key` tab and click `Copy`.
