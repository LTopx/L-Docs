# Token

### What is a Token?

- Tokens are the basic unit that LLM models use to compute the length of a text. They are groups of characters, which sometimes align with words, but not always. In particular, it depends on the number of characters and includes punctuation signs or emojis.

### How does token work?

- It is calculated according to the rules of each language model based on the total length of the current session content.
- When the conversation reaches a certain length, you will no longer be able to add any more messages to the conversation. This is a contextual limit on the conversation content of each language model.
- For example, GPT-3.5 allows a maximum of 4,096 tokens per session. GPT-4 allows a maximum of 8,192 tokens per session in its 8K model, and a maximum of 32,768 tokens in its 32K model. The context length limit may increase for various language models in the future.
- If the current conversation reaches the context limit, you can delete some of the conversation content or start a new conversation to continue chatting.

### How to cost?

- Any content related to a chat conversation will incur conversation costs.
- All costs are "estimated values" calculated by [openai/tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken).
- Each language model has its own pricing, and the corresponding official website has a detailed description of the pricing.

### Token Recharge

- If you use your own API Key, then token consumption is calculated towards your API Key.
- If you don't have your own API Key, you can recharge your token limit to use Le-AI.
  - Token recharge prices are calculated based on the normal price and platform handling fees. The charging standard is to ensure that the author does not lose money. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
