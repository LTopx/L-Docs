# OpenRouter API KEY Configuration

You can use L-GPT without logging in, but you must configure it to use your own API key.

### API KEY

Configure your own OpenRouter API KEY. [Get the API KEY here](https://openrouter.ai/)

- OpenRouter is an aggregator of large-scale model API services, which includes almost all mainstream language model services on the market.
- Obtaining an API KEY is very simple, just register an account and generate it directly.
- If not configured, you must use the author's provided API KEY service after logging in.

### Temperature

> Official definition: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

In L-GPT, this setting has been simplified to only three modes to choose from: Deterministic/Neutral/Randomness. You can adjust this parameter according to your needs.

### Max Tokens

> Since the maximum token limit for PaLM models in OpenRouter is set at 1025, it is temporarily limited to 1025 in L-GPT as well.

The maximum number of tokens generated per chat session.

The input token and generated token lengths are limited by the context length of the model.
