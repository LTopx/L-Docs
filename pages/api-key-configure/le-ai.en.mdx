# Le-AI API Key

### What is Le-AI?

Le-AI API Key is an authentication method provided by Le-AI for users. Users can use this API Key to access the services of Le-AI. All keys start with `leai-`.

### How to generate

- Generate on the "Account Center - Token Management" page in the upper right corner of the system.
- The Le-AI API Key is generated by the main account, and each main account can generate up to 3 keys.
- Each API Key can be configured with enable status, quota limit, expiration time, and other attributes.
- Unwanted keys can be deleted at any time.

### How to use

- <div className="font-bold text-rose-500">
    Note that once a Le-AI API Key is configured, its configuration will take
    precedence. Other Keys from OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and OpenRouter (even if
    configured) will be ignored.
  </div>
- After configuring the Le-AI API token on the model configuration page, you can use all Le-AI services within your main account's permissions without logging in.
- All quotas consumed by Le-AI API tokens will be counted towards your main account's quota.
- In future versions of `Le-AI Client`, we will adopt a token-based approach using Le-AI APIs.
