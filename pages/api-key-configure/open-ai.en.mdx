# OpenAI API Key Configuration

You can use L-GPT without logging in, but you must configure it to use your own API Key.

### API Key

Configure your own OpenAI API Key. [Get API Key here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

- OpenAI's API Key is a string of characters that starts with sk-xxxxx
- If not configured, the API Key service provided by the author must be used after logging in.
- You can also check if the API Key you entered is correct by calling the official /dashboard/billing/subscription API.

### API Proxy

- By default, use the official API endpoint: https://api.openai.com
- Due to certain circumstances, certain regions cannot directly access the official API. If you have set up your own forwarding service, you can configure your forwarding service address here. We recommend using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to create your forwarding service.

### Temperature

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

This configuration has been simplified in L-GPT, providing only three modes to choose from: Deterministic/Neutral/Random. You can adjust this parameter according to your own needs.

### Max Tokens

> In L-GPT, the max tokens are set to 2000 by default.

The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion.

The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
