# API Key Configure

Currently, L-GPT supports configuring API keys for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI. In the future, it will continue to support more large language models. (Because the author himself only applied for these two keys ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£, it is not convenient to develop and debug the entire process without other keys.)

Consider supporting other third-party integrated API services in the future, such as [api2d](https://api2d.com/).
