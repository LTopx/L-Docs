# Conversation Setting

### Initial setup

When starting a new session, you can directly click on the central area of the page to perform some basic configuration for the current session. You can choose to use different AI language models for the session and also set the prompt that the current session wants to use.

Currently, only four types of prompts are built-in. In the future, a prompt market will be developed to provide more efficient and usable prompts. Of course, you can also customize your own prompts.

### Setting up the conversation

After successfully initiating a conversation, you can adjust some basic settings of the current conversation by clicking on the conversation title.

Currently, you can adjust the language model used in the current conversation, as well as the title of the conversation. More customizable settings will be available in the future.
