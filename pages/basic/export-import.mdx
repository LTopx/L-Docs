# Export / Import

Currently, all session records and API Keys of L-GPT are saved locally in the browser (cloud storage feature will be available in the future). However, it also provides import and export functions for users to quickly transfer their local data to other devices and browsers.

### One-click export

Export a JSON formatted file. One-click export supports exporting the following content:

- Chat conversation records
- Locally configured API keys
- Basic configurations of various language models
- Locally customized prompts (to be improved)

### One-click import

Simply select the exported JSON file. (Note that this will overwrite your local chat history and API key configuration.)
