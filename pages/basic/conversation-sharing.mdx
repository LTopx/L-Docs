### Quick view

After successful sharing, you can directly copy the link or open to view the shared session content. You can also share it to Twitter with one click.

If you don't want to cancel the content shared in this session, you can delete the sharing directly. If you are a logged-in user, you can also choose whether to share anonymously. (Users who are not logged in always share anonymously)
