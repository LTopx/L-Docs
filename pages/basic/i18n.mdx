L-GPT supports multiple languages internationalization powered by [next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/).

You can quickly switch languages through the menu in the lower left corner. The initial language loaded will be based on your browser's default language. Currently, only Chinese and English are supported, and more languages will be supported in the future.
